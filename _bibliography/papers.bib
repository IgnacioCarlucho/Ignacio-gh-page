title={Semi-Parametric Control Architecture for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Subject to Time Delays},
journal={IEEE Access (Under Review)},
year={2023},
abstract={This paper presents a data-driven model-based control system for autonomous underwater vehicles (or AUVs) subject to input delays. This work is motivated by the input time delays that can arise in underwater robotics due to communication restrictions and sensor malfunctions. Such delays can highly degrade the performance of classical control structures resulting in unpredictable system behaviours. The proposed control architecture addresses such limitations. The approach incorporates a linear dynamic representation of the system obtained using the Koopman operator in an observer/state prediction formulation. The proposed control architecture is designed based on  discrepancies between the data-driven estimation of the system's behaviour and the actual AUV performance using chain predictors.  The capabilities of the proposed approach are shown through experiments performed with a $4$ degrees-of-freedom autonomous underwater vehicle. The results demonstrate  stable behaviours without steady-state errors, even in the presence of long delay.},

abstract={ Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) is the challenge of designing a robust learner agent that effectively collaborates with unknown teammates without prior coordination mechanisms. Early approaches address the AHT challenge by training the learner with a diverse set of handcrafted teammate policies, usually designed based on an expert's domain knowledge about the policies the learner may encounter. However, implementing teammate policies for training based on domain knowledge is not always feasible. In such cases, recent approaches attempted to improve the robustness of the learner by training it with teammate policies generated by optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics. The problem with optimising existing information-theoretic diversity metrics for teammate policy generation is the emergence of superficially different teammates. When used for AHT training, superficially different teammate behaviours may not improve a learner's robustness during collaboration with unknown teammates. In this paper, we present an automated teammate policy generation method optimising the Best-Response Diversity (BRDiv) metric, which measures diversity based on the compatibility of teammate policies in terms of returns. We evaluate our approach in environments with multiple valid coordination strategies, comparing against methods optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics and an ablation not optimising any diversity metric. Our experiments indicate that optimising BRDiv yields a diverse set of training teammate policies that improve the learner's performance relative to previous teammate generation approaches when collaborating with near-optimal previously unseen teammate policies.},

Towards this goal, the Autonomous Agents Research Group develops novel machine learning algorithms for autonomous systems control, with a specific focus on deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Research problems include scalable learning of coordinated agent policies and inter-agent communication; reasoning about the behaviours, goals, and composition of other agents from limited observations; and sample-efficient learning based on intrinsic motivation, curriculum learning, causal inference, and representation learning.

  abstract={This paper presents the design of a novel expert system for robotic manipulators performing sanding tasks on work surfaces. The expert system adjusts the velocity of the robotic manipulator based on the observed surface quality. These observation are obtained by an analysis of the raw force data provided by a force-torque sensor at the end-effector level. The expert system consists of two governing control laws that act in parallel, a variable velocity generation law and a pose regulation-based law. The variable velocity law regulates the velocity of the manipulator along a set path, in the tangent direction, based on an analysis of the frequency and amplitude of the force signal generated during the sanding process. The pose regulation-based law drives the manipulator in the bi-normal and rotational direction, ensuring the manipulators remain on the sanding path with the desired orientation. The proposed strategy is experimentally evaluated using the UR5e collaborative robotic manipulator sanding wood and metal panels. The obtained results show that such an approach is beneficial to ensure accurate contact between the sanding tool and the working environment, robust path tracking, and smart sanding.},

  abstract={We present MIDGARD, an open-source simulation platform for autonomous robot navigation in outdoor unstructured environments. MIDGARD is designed to enable the training of autonomous agents (e.g., unmanned ground vehicles) in photorealistic 3D environments, and to support the generalization skills of learning-based agents through the variability in training scenarios. MIDGARD's main features include a configurable, extensible, and difficulty-driven procedural landscape generation pipeline, with fast and photorealistic scene rendering based on Unreal Engine. Additionally, MIDGARD has built-in support for OpenAI Gym, a programming interface for feature extension (e.g., integrating new types of sensors, customizing exposing internal simulation variables), and a variety of simulated agent sensors (e.g., RGB, depth and instance/semantic segmentation). We evaluate MIDGARD's capabilities as a benchmarking tool for robot navigation utilizing a set of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. The results demonstrate MIDGARD's suitability as a simulation and training environment, as well as the effectiveness of our procedural generation approach in controlling scene difficulty, which directly reflects on accuracy metrics.},

  abstract={Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are platforms used for research and exploration of marine environments. However, these types of vehicles face many challenges that hinder their widespread use in the industry. One of the main limitations is obtaining accurate position estimation, due to the lack of GPS signal underwater. This estimation is usually done with Kalman filters. However, new developments in the neuroscience field have shed light on the mechanisms by which mammals are able to obtain a reliable estimation of their current position based on external and internal motion cues. A new type of neuron, called Grid cells, has been shown to be part of path integration system in the brain. In this article, we show how grid cells can be used for obtaining a position estimation of underwater vehicles. The model of grid cells used requires only the linear velocities together with heading orientation and provides a reliable estimation of the vehicle's position. We provide simulation results for an AUV which show the feasibility of our proposed methodology.},
