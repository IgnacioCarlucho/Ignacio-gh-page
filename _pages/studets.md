     Co-supervised with Profesor Yvan Petillot <br>
     Project title: Lifelong Learning for Vision based AUV Control <br>
     The main objective is to design a low-level controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using learning frameworks. The algorithm should be portable across multiple robots. The controller should adapt quickly to any change in the dynamics (e.g. increase of payload, current disturbances or thruster efficiency decay)
